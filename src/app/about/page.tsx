          <p className='text-gray-500 text-md md:text-lg lg:text-3xl p-7'>I&apos;m Mehak Khan, a passionate frontend developer with a keen eye for detail and a love for bringing designs to life. While I&apos;m just starting my professional journey in the development world, I&apos;ve spent countless hours honing my skills in HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I&apos;m also building a solid foundation in React and Next.js, and I love working with Shadcn UI to create beautiful, functional interfaces. My proficiency in Figma ensures that every project I touch is pixel-perfect and true to its design.

            Beyond the code, I hold a B.Com degree from Karachi University, which has equipped me with a strong understanding of problem-solving and critical thinking â€“ skills I readily apply to my development work. I&apos;m excited to collaborate on innovative projects and contribute to a team where I can grow and make a tangible impact.
